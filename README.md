# mi-flash-card
This is a Flash Card mobile app, as part of the React Nanodegree program. This mobile app allows people to create and manage decks of flash cards for their own use

## If you don't have expo, you should install it first
```
npm install --global expo-cli
```

## To run the project:
```
npm install
expo start
```

## Notes:
- The project used [expo init](https://docs.expo.io/) instead of [create-react-native-app] to start
- I have mainly tested the app on Android and Web, not iOS

## Features:
- [x] Create/remove deck
- [x] Add new card to deck
- [x] Quiz
- [ ] Cards management (to be added in the future)
